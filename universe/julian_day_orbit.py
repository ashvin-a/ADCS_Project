##Then compute all the planets using the JPL class
planets = JPL(julian_day)

#Finally compute all the orbits
planets.MilkyWay.Orbit()

##Finally Plot the Output of the Systems
print('Creating Plots')
pp = PDF(0,plt)

##Plot All planets
planets.MilkyWay.PlotOrbit(pp,-1)

##Only plot inner planets
planets.MilkyWay.numsatellites = 5
planets.MilkyWay.PlotOrbit(pp,-1)
pp.close()
sys.exit()

##Animation??
planets.MilkyWay.numsatellites = 6 + 1 #The plus one is because of loops in Python. I know I probably need to fix the loop but whatever
pa = PDF(1,plt)

#Inputs are the 
#julian_day = defined above
#day_skip = how many days to skip
day_skip = 1.0
#num_skips = the number of skips (must be integer!!)
num_skips = 365
#pause_time = how long to pause

##Use Mayavi if you're using Python3
#planets.MilkyWay.numsatellites = 10
#planets.MilkyWay.PlotMayavi()
